# AI-driven assessment of semantic similarity between scale items

Using a dataset of responses to scale items, different AI-driven strategies are evaluated to estimate the extent to which response of participants may be predicted from the seimantic similarity of the items comprised in the scales. Success is evaluated by assessing the association between the semantic similarity with the correlation of answers from the same items in participants. The semantic representations of scale items are obtained from large language models.
