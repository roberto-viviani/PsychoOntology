# This is a utility to prepare scales to be embedded starting from an excel
# spreadsheet, like Scales.xls. It loads the scales data from this excel
# file and saves a scales.csv file in the main directory.
#
# The embedding code expects a csv file with the columns item_de and item_en
# containing the scale items in German and English, respectively, or a column
# item if there is only one language.Â´
